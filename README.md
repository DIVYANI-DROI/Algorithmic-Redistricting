# Algorithmic-Redistricting
**Deep Reinforcement Learning project for District Division.**

Our Project was to build a Deep Reinforcement Learning Model to perform redistricting in the state of Iowa. 

## Problem Statement

- Redistricting Plans can potentially have bias involved in the way they are done and while no Machine Learning Model is free from biases because they are programmed by us at the end of the day, but what we can do is at least bring insights from data to make a more fairer redistricting plan that can potray a more accurate depiction of the actual population vote distribution.

## Tools
- Programming Language - Python
  - Librabries - Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn 
  - Deep Learning Framework - PyTorch
  - Developement Environment - Google Collab, Jupyter Notebook
